An interactive data analysis project for the Ford GoBike System using Excel and Power Query. I transformed 183,416 records into a visual dashboard to analyze user demographics, trip durations, and station traffic. The project provides actionable insights to optimize bike distribution and improve marketing strategies for different user segments.
