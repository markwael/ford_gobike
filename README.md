# 🚴‍♂️ Ford GoBike System Data Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Ford GoBike** system. By analyzing a dataset of over **183,416 bike trips**, I developed an interactive Excel Dashboard to uncover user behaviors, demographic trends, and peak station activities to drive data-driven business decisions.

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **User Segmentation**: Subscribers dominate the service base, with **122,850 Male Subscribers** forming the core user group.
* **Trip Duration Contrast**: Casual **Customers** spend an average of **24 minutes** per trip, while **Subscribers** spend only **11 minutes**, suggesting different use cases (leisure vs. commute).
* **Demographics**: Peak activity is concentrated in the **20–30 age group**, with a significant spike around **age 22**.
* **Station Traffic**: Identified the top 10 hubs, with **Market St at 10th St** leading as the primary start station and **Berry St at 4th St** as the top destination.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Excel & Power Query**: For data cleaning, handling missing birth years, and time-format transformations.
* **Pivot Tables**: To aggregate large-scale data and calculate averages and totals.
* **Data Visualization**: Created an interactive dashboard with Slicers for gender and user type filtering.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Targeted Campaigns**: Focus on converting the **5,391 female customers** into subscribers to bridge the current gender gap.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Prioritize bike rebalancing and maintenance at the top 10 stations to ensure availability during peak hours.
3. **Leisure Pricing**: Introduce specialized "Leisure Passes" for longer trips to better monetize the casual "Customer" segment.
